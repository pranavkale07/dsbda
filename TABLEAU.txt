Hereâ€™s a complete step-by-step guide for performing visualizations in Tableau using the Adult Census dataset to answer Task 23 business questions:

âœ… STEP 1: Load Dataset
Open Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public

âœ… STEP 2: Clean Data (Optional but Recommended)
Rename fields if needed (e.g., native-country â†’ Country, income â†’ IncomeClass).

Replace missing values ("?") with NULL or filter them out using filters in worksheets.

ðŸš€ TASK-WISE VISUALIZATION
a. Find and Plot Income Class of People with Masterâ€™s and Doctorate

f. Country-wise Male-Female Ratio
Drag native-country to Rows.

Drag gender to **Columns`.

Drag Number of Records to **SizeorText`.

Use Side-by-Side Bar Chart or Stacked Bar Chart:

Columns: native-country

Rows: Number of Records

Color: gender

To show ratio:

Create a calculated field:

tableau
Copy
Edit
IF [gender] = "Male" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
And compute ratio using table calculations or dual axis chart.

g. Income Class Based on Workclass (Government and Other)
Drag workclass to Filters â†’ Select only:
