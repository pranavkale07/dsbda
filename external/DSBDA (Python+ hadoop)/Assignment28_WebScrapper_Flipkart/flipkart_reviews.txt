Comment: Fulfilled my expectations.The Stunning Design, Display, new One UI 6.1, new AI are the highlights of it.However, Flipkart service is worst.Part of pre-booking offer, they are supposed to provide,free wireless charge, but not provided. I don't recommend Flipkart.

Comment: Liked the product. As expected from a Samsung device, it has a brilliant display and camera. The performance is great too. Phone is fast and snappy. What I didn't like is the battery performance. It's fairly decent. My 3 yr old OnePlus 9R was giving similar batter life (a difference of max 15-20 mins screen on time)Charging could be faster too. Expected at least a 45W capacity but still not a deal breakerAnother point is fingerprint sensor doesn't work properly with a screen guard. I didn't...

Comment: I am not happy with battery performance ..I spend 70k for this phone and everything that a premium phone can perform it did on top but battery life just ruined everything..
